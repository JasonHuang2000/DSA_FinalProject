In Star Wars, the Bakurans were humans inhabiting the planet [Bakura]. Bakurans developed a distinct culture due to their isolated location and their lack of contact with any nonhuman beings besides the Kurtzen natives. The Bakurans descended from the Bakuran Mining Cor- poration colonists who arrived at the planet around 150 BBY. They soon broke away from the corporate control and created their own senate and elected a Prime Minister. The leader of the 150 BBY Bakuran Mining Corporation expedition, Deredith Ardenâ€™s descendants were the leaders of the Bakurian government. In 4 ABY the Bakurans joined force with the Alliance to Restore the Republic to ward off the attacking Ssi-Ruuk, a saurian species from the Unknown Regions of the galaxy, who planned to conquer the planet.
